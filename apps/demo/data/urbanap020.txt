  Description:
    Abstract:
      This coverage was identified on the USGS Water Resources NSDI Node site at <http://nsdi.usgs.gov>. This data set includes a selection of urban areas in the United States derived from the urban areas layer of the Digital Chart of 
      the World (DCW).The data was then modified by the US Environmental Protection Agency Personnel for use in the Southern Forest Resource Assessment and exported to a shapefile. The USGS FGDC compliant metadata was then modified to reflect any data set edits completed by the US Environmental Protection Agency Personnel. (see process description starting on page 4).
    Purpose:
      The digital data sets of the National Atlas are used to create electronic and hard 
      copy maps that depict various aspects of the nation.  The data can be used to 
      conduct geographic analysis on National and large regional scales. The digital 
      data will provide a basis from which future revisions of the atlas can be derived.
    Supplemental_Information:
      USGS Revisions on source coverage:
      1) 6/29/98 - Corrected ellipsoid name from WGS84 to GRS1980 and
      changed flattening ratio.
      2) 11/13/98 - Added State FIPS attribute; move polygons for Altus, OK and
      Olustee, OK; and edited STATES field for Kansas City and Washington Metro
      Area.
      US Enviromental Protection Agency Shapefile Information:
      The states included within the dataset include: AL, AR, FL, GA, KY, LA, MS, NC, OK, SC, TN, TX, and VA

      Process_Description:
        USGS Process Description: Urban polygons from the Digital Chart of the World (DCW)
        CD-ROM were extracted and converted to ARC/INFO format.  Where
        the urban boundaries extend beyond the 1:2M shoreline, the 2M
        shoreline was used by "CLIPPING" the urban polygons.  Names of
        the urban areas were added. In large metropolitan areas many
        smaller areas were labeled as part of the metropolitan area.
        The state in which the urban area is located was also added.  Several
        areas were modified to conform to the 1:2,000,000-scale hydrography
        layer.  Some smaller polygons that represent undeveloped areas
        within the urban area were removed and merged with the larger
        urban area.  Military reservations were also removed.

      Process_Description:
        Data Modifications by US Environmental Protection Agency Personnel: 
        Sept. & Oct.-2000: The coverages were downloaded by US Environmental Agency personnel on 22-Sep-2000 in compressed Arc Info Export format along with their associated metadata. The coverages were then reprojected and clipped to match Assessment standard Albers projection and State Assessment coverage boundary coordinates. This process used the Arc Info PROJECT and CLIP command. The coverage then exported as a shapefile.
