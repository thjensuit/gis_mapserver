  Description:
    Abstract:
      This coverage was identified on the USGS Water Resources NSDI Node 
      site at <http://nsdi.usgs.gov>. The data set portrays the linear water 
      features of the Eastern United States. The USGS original file was 
      produced by joining the individual State hydrography layers from the 
      1:2,000,000-scale Digital Line Graph (DLG) data produced by the
      USGS. This is a revised version of the March 1999 data set. The data was 
      then modified by the US Environmental Protection Agency Personnel 
      for use  in the Southern Forest Resource Assessment and exported to a shapefile. 
      The USGS FGDC compliant metadata was then modified to reflect any 
      data set edits completed by the US Environmental Protection Agency 
      Personnel. (see process description starting on page 6).
    Purpose:
      These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the national 
      level, and for large regional areas.  The data should be displayed and 
      analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale data.
    Supplemental_Information: The states included within the dataset include:  AL, AR, FL, GA, KY, LA, MS, NC, OK, SC, TN, TX, and VA

        USGS Process Description #1: The 2MILHY data files were originally 
        digitized by the National Mapping Division based on the sectional 
        maps contained in 'The National Atlas of the United States of
        America' published by the USGS in 1970.  The 1:2,000,000-scale 
        Digital Line Graph (DLG) data were merged into a single national 
        hydrography coverage. Where necessary to effect the merge, 
        alignment changes were made.  The names were taken from 
        the USGS1:100,000-scale base maps.  For Alaska, the 
        names were taken from the 1:250,000-scale sheets.  State
        lines across water bodies were removed from the national
        coverage.  State attributes were assigned to the features.

        Sept. & Oct.-2000: The coverages were downloaded by US Environmental Agency personnel on 22-Sep-2000 in compressed Arc Info Export format along with their associated metadata. The coverages were then reprojected and clipped to match Assessment standard Albers projection and State Assessment coverage boundary coordinates. This process used the Arc Info PROJECT and CLIP command. The coverage then exported as a shapefile.
