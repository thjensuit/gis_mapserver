  Description:
    Abstract:
      This coverage was identified on the USGS Water Resources NSDI Node site
      at <http://nsdi.usgs.gov>. The data set portrays the major roads in the 
      United States.  The file was produced by joining the individual State roads
      layers from the 1:2,000,000-scale Digital Line Graph (DLG) data produced 
      by the USGS.  This is a revised version of the March 1999 data set.
      The data was then modified by the US Environmental Protection 
      Agency Personnel for use in the Southern Forest Resource 
      Assessment and exported to a shapefile. The USGS FGDC compliant 
      metadata was then modified to reflect any data set edits completed 
      by the US Environmental Protection Agency Personnel (see process
      description starting on page 5).
    Purpose:
      These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the
      national level, and for large regional areas.  The data should be 
      displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale
      data.

      US Environmental Protection Agency Shapefile Information:
      The states included within the dataset include: AL, AR, FL, GA, KY, LA, MS, NC, OK, SC, TN, TX, and VA

        USGS Process Description #1: The 2MILRD data files 
        were originally digitized by the National Mapping Division
        based on the sectional maps contained in 'The National 
        Atlas of the United States of America' published by the
        USGS in 1970.  The files were updated and the ARC/INFO
        software command DLGARC was used to convert the 
        State DLG optional-format files to ARC/INFO coverages.  
        The individual State coverages were then merged together
        using the ARC/INFO command APPEND.

        compressed Arc Info Export format along with their associated 
        metadata. The coverages were then reprojected and clipped 
        to match Assessment standard Albers projection and State 
        Assessment coverage boundary coordinates. This process 
        used the Arc Info PROJECT and CLIP command. The
